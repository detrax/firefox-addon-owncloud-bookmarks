# ownCloud Bookmarks
Add-on for syncing bookmarks with ownCloud.

For now the synchronization is only one-way, from ownCloud to Firefox.
This means all bookmarks in the configured folder will be overwritten with the ones from ownCloud.

The password is retrieved from the password store. The easiest way to fill it is:

- Enable saving passwords in Firefox preferences
- Go to your ownCloud
- Log in with you user
- Save the password
